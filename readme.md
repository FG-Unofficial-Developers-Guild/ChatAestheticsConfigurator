INTRODUCTION

Okay, so what does it do? Well, the Chat Aesthetics Configurator replaces some of the standard icons in the chat window with a set of icons I've designed to match many of the other images I've used in other extensions. Further, it replaces some of the fonts and their styles. For me, these align with my aesthetic sensibilities. If they don't align with yours, no worries... just swap out whatever you'd like. Or don't use it.

What does this mean? Well, when there is a "hit"... the players will see a fancy "hit" icon with text colors to match. Same for "miss" or "crit" or several other actions and effects. Further, this adds a "GM" icon to align with the look and feel of the rest of the chat icons.

If you want to get that "whole suite" feel, this extension pairs nicely with MATTEKURE's "Fantasy Grounds 5E Indicators", Mad Nomad's "Mad Nomad's Interactive Portraits", and SirMotte's "Magnificent Darkness - Hearth Edition" theme, among others.

I will do my best to support whatever issues come up, but at the bank-breaking price of zero gold, I can only do what I can do in my spare time. It goes without saying, but I'll say it, use the extension at your own risk.


INSTRUCTIONS

By default, just enable it and it should work out of the box. Go into options under "Chat Aesthetics Configurator" and select both the font theme and icon theme you want to use. Over time I will roll more themes into the extension.

Important: If you have an old version of the extension from the forum, you will need to delete it or Fantasy Grounds will use the old version. Further, I changed the name... so best to start fresh. This does everything the old one does, better, and more.


ICON THEMES

- Off - uses the standard Fantasy Grounds icons
- Simple - uses enhanced icons with no containers
- Hex - uses enhanced icons with a hex container
- Round - uses enhanced icons with a round container
- Square - uses enhanced icons with a square container

FONT THEMES

- Off - uses the default fonts
- Hearth - optimized for the "hearth" theme 
- Light Text - for use on dark themes
- Dark Text - for use on light themes

GM ICON

- Sorry - you are stuck with the default for now... these aren't wired up to the options panel yet. 
- If you are adventurous, reverse engineer the extension.

Please note that some global icons, like "effects" or "powers," will leverage the Chat Aesthetics Configurator version of the icon no matter what you choose in options. I am working on a way to let you control those icons as well, but today is not that day.

For advanced users: To change any of the above with your own styles and icons, rename the extension to "Chat Aesthetics Configurator.zip" and unzip it. Edit the files and swap the icons to your heart's content. Zip it back up, rename it so whatever you want -- if not, it will get overwritten the next time Forge updates.


ATTRIBUTION

First, a shout out to VALEROS for his original extension, "Chat Window - Attack Rolls - Big Icons, Fonts, and Color - Great for TV use" as found in the Fantasy Grounds Forum. Next, a thank you to MATTEKURE for his evolution of the extension and guidance. Finally, SirMotte for his patience and support. For my part, All I did was do a bit of simplification, code clean-up, and then introduce a bit of flexibility around theming things.


CHANGES

v0.10-0.70 - These were a train-wreck... good thing you didn't have to deal with them.
v0.80 - Basic functionality.
v0.90 - Introduces new themes, new font styles, and the ability to choose font and icon themes in the options panel. simplified the code a bit. Reduced the size of the "brand" icon at load. Swapped the "GM" icon to be square -- looks better next to the text.
v1.00 - Optimizations and a new icon set. Fixed the double-entry in setting. 


ROADMAP

- I am hoping to add icons for all of the conditions (e.g. grappled)... at some point.
- Set fonts for entire chat box. (I have this wired, but it collides with themes like Hearth, so I've turned it off for now)
- I am going to add a few more icon and font themes -- hit the forum and make suggestions.
- Introduce a minimalist "dot" icon set for a super-clean look. (Kinda Done)
- Add the ability to use a player portrait instead of the enhanced icons.
- Adding themes with smaller fonts.. and different fonts.


KNOWN ISSUES

- Themes do not change all icons yet... mostly just the "roll" icons.
- Some font settings don't seem to fire... like "effect."
- Using this extension MAY change some of the icons in on the "action" tab... specifically, the "Spells" icon.
- I am sure there are other issues.
- Need to continue tweak the colors a bit.
